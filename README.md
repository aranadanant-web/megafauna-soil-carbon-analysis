Megafauna Soil Carbon Analysis

Project Overview:
Comparative analysis of large herbivore impacts on soil carbon storage using experimental herbivore exclusion data from UHURU (Kenya) to explain ecological consequences of Pleistocene megafauna extinction in Siberia.

Research Question:
How does the disappearance of large herbivores affect soil quality and carbon storage, using experimental exclusion data from African savannas as an analog to megafauna extinction in Siberia?

Hypothesis:
Exclusion of large herbivores results in vegetation structure changes (increased trees/shrubs) that alter soil properties, similar to effects observed after Pleistocene megafauna extinction.

Data Sources:
UHURU Experiment (Dryad) - 12 years of large herbivore exclusion data from African savanna
Windirsch et al. 2022 - Reference article on intensive grazing and carbon in Siberian permafrost

Repository Structure:
data/raw/ - Original UHURU data files
data/processed/ - Cleaned data for analysis
notebooks/ - Jupyter/Colab notebooks
docs/ - Reports and documentation
figures/ - Generated plots

Key Variables:
Treatment - OPEN, MEGA, MESO, TOTAL (exclusion levels)
Tree metrics - Height, circumference, density
Herbivore presence - Dung counts
Climate - Rainfall

Analysis Plan:
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Statistical analysis and visualization
5. Comparison with Siberian permafrost study
